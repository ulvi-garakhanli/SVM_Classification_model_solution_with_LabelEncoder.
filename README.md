Support Vector Machines Classification model:
In this project, we start pre-processing. Upload data, describe all, looked unique values of dependent and because of that 
we used LabelEncoder. There is an outlier and we treated it. Checked missing values and look at correlation. After pre-processing
the next Modelling. First, we fit our Default model, next, fit our Optimized model and get high accuracy.
